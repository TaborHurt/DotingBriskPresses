today i plan to mimic google classroom 

close out: Took me 30 minutes to complete 15 minutes of your video dew to my struggles with logging into shell. Couldnt figure out how to get my git config to work but finally did. Just a little overwhelming but we'll figure it out as we go. going to finish the rest of the video tomorrow.

I finsihed up, eveyrthing went smooth (I forgot to check in, my bad)
